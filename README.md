# BusyBus

It's been a journey - from concept, to research, to prototype, and now finally to code. It has been an incredibly rewarding experience to learn the fundamentals and package up all that knowledge into a simple solution that solves a problem people are facing in their day-to-day lives. As rewarding as it has been, it also has certainly been daunting, frustrating, and sometimes felt impossible to get to the point to submit this assignment. I learned a lot of things about front-end development that made me very appreciative of developers. Often times, looking back at my own design, I felt like I was looking at a dish, not knowing the ingredients, yet trying with all my might to cook the dish anyway. 

Nailing the box-model has been and still is one of my greatest challenges that I've faced with this frontend portion of my Bloc journey. I learned that div tags are my friend and that section tags are outdated. I learned how to leverage unordered lists. I learned that it's really crucial to set up your HTML as mindfully as possible because it _will_ complicate and add unnecessary complexity when it comes to styling. I learned that it takes a *lot* of attention to detail to make visual design come to life. Though honestly this section has been really difficult and probably not what I want to spend my time doing as a designer, I do see the value in acquiring these skills and I look forward to learning more frontend development skills as my Bloc journey continues.
